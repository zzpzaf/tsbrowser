Summary of the post
--------------------
Coming from other backgrounds and wanting to start playing with Typescript asap, is quite likely that you will fail in some trouble trying to make a simple browser-based project. 
Which for pure JavaScript world looks like a piece of cake: just a stylesheet and a JavaScript file, linked in an HTML file. However, trying to do something similar with Typescript
requires a bit more effort, especially if you are not familiar enough with how to deal with some very fundamental concepts. 
The module management system is one of the very fundamental concepts and you should be able to make the appropriate choices in configuration settings in your project.

The goal is to start working with typescript files (=modules) in Typescript projects, -using the (new) standard way- without being bothered about JavaScript backward compatibility issues.  
This post aims to add some grasp on that.

This post also provides a minimum yet a standard solution for all those who have some programming knowledge (e.g. in JavaScript), 
and who like to benefit from the capabilities of Typescript (OOP, strictly typed, etc.). So, if someone wants to start playing with Typescript and he is looking 
for a quick way to implement a simple Typescript project that it runs just in a browser, then this post enlightens a bit about this process.
